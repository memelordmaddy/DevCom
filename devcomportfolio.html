            <h3>Quizzing</h3>
            <p>I've always enjoyed reading up random stuff which ends up being useful for acing quizzes. IITB gave me the opportunity to be a part of the Inter IIT Quiz contingent, and I'm looking forward to attending more quizzes representing IITB.

            <h3>Football</h3>
            <p>Hailing from a place known for its Football culture, I've invested a significant part of my life playing and watching football. I'm a loyal fan of FC Barcelona, supporting the team through their ups and downs (mostly downs these days) has taught me numerous life lessons.</p>

            <h3>Reading Non-fiction</h3>
            <p>Did I start reading non-fiction for quizzing or start quizzing because I read non-fiction? I don't know, to be honest. Either way, I love reading non-fiction and try my best to find time to read.</p>
